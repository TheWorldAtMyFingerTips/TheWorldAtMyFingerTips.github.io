## DOES THE BRAND/RANK OF A SCHOOL MATTER?
<br/>
You've been there.<br/>
All of us have been there.<br/><br/>
Society's eternal debate of - _Does the brand/rank of a school matter?_ <br/><br/>
In a similar vein, I've been having internal debates of which is better: Full-time diploma with a polytechnic or, full-time certified trainings with a course provider.<br/>

Truth is, though I've went to somewhat prestigious primary, secondary, and university schools... excelled in my studies, places of work, and (now) course projects... I still feel "insufficient".<br/><br/>
The most pressing thorn at the moment being, feeling inferior to a full-time diploma Data Analytics grad (I am a full-time Associate Data Analyst student with NTUCLearningHub and Xaltius).<br/>

And so... in a bid to remove that thorn, I've taken to research (via the internet, books, speaking with people), to derive peace and confidence from the following points:<br/>
* Full-time diploma courses (in Singapore) are a 3-year stint which trains you from the _basics of the basics_ (most students do not have years of hands-on related industry experience);
* My full-time 9-month course trained me from the basics of Data Science (I've already got the basics of the basics solidified from my years of experience at work).
* Furthermore, my course curriculum ensured optimal applied learning through its hefty weightage of projects which replicates real-life working situations.
* Yes the learning environment and time plays a part in the learning process, but as like all other things in life, it is not the sole determinant of what you can achieve/accomplish.

Ultimately, **the coefficient of our growth is ourselves.**<br/>
**WE ARE THE POWER OF HOW POWERFUL WE BECOME** (pun intended).<br/>

How clear-minded and focused we are to achieve our objective(s).<br/>
How our attitude and mindset contribute towards learning.<br/>
How determined, tenacious, resilient we are to achieve our objective(s).<br/>
How much we learn through the practice and application of knowledge to real-life-projects.<br/>
 
We all are a product of our experiences. <br/>
Though some of us have access to advantages, ultimately who we are, what we become, how much we #learn and achieve is solely dependent on us.<br/>
Put in minimal effort at the "best" school and get minimal knowledge and achievements.<br/>
Put in maximum effort at an "average" school and get more than minimal knowledge and achievements.<br/>

We determine how much we want to learn.<br/>
We determine how much we want to achieve.<br/>
We are the source of how much we can achieve.<br/>
A "good" school can only teach that much to an individual who does not have a good mindset and attitude towards learning.<br/>
A growth mindset takes one further than a fixed mindset ever could.<br/>

Case in point, I was feeling unconfident.<br/>
So I did the research and analysis to gain clarity and uncover the belief and confidence that I am in fact, better than good!<br/>
As Sonia Sotomayor said, "A surplus of effort could overcome a deficit of confidence." It certainly did for me.<br/>
Make the effort. Take action.<br/><br/>

**WE ARE THE POWER OF HOW POWERFUL WE BECOME.<br/>
WHAT EXPONENTIAL DID YOU CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF TODAY?**<br/>
