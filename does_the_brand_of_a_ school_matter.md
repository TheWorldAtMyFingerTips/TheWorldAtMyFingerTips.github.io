## DOES THE BRAND/RANK OF A SCHOOL MATTER?

You've been there. All of us have been there.
Society's eternal debate of - _Does the brand/rank of a school matter?_
In a similar vein, I've been having internal debates of which is better - Full-time diploma with a polytechnic or, full-time certified trainings with a course provider.

Truth is, though I've went to somewhat prestigious primary, secondary, and university schools... excelled in my studies, places of work, and now course projects... I still feel "insufficient".
The most pressing thorn at the moment being, feeling inferior to a full-time diploma #DataAnalytics grad (I am a full-time Associate Data Analyst student with #NTUCLearningHub #Xaltius).

And so... in a bid to remove that thorn, I've taken to research (via the internet, books, speaking with people), to derive peace and confidence from the following points:
* Full-time diploma courses (in Singapore) are a 3-year stint which trains you from the basics of the basics (most students do not have years of hands-on related industry experience); My full-time 9-month course trained me from the basics of Data Science (I've already got the basics of the basics solidified from my years of experience at work).
Furthermore, my course curriculum ensured optimal applied learning through its hefty weightage of projects which replicates real-life working situations.
* Yes the learning environment and time plays a part in the learning process, but as like all other things in life, it is not the sole determinant of what you can achieve/accomplish.


Ultimately, **the coefficient of our growth is ourselves.**
**WE ARE THE POWER OF HOW POWERFUL WE BECOME** (pun intended).

How clear-minded and focused we are to achieve our objective(s).
How our attitude and mindset contribute towards learning.
How determined, tenacious, resilient we are to achieve our objective(s).
How much we learn through the practice and application of knowledge to real-life-projects.
 
We all are a product of our experiences. Though some of us have access to advantages, ultimately who we are, what we become, how much we #learn and achieve is solely dependent on us.
Put in minimal effort at the "best" school and get minimal knowledge and achievements.
Put in maximum effort at an "average" school and get more than minimal knowledge and achievements.

We determine how much we want to learn.
We determine how much we want to achieve.
We are the source of how much we can achieve.
A "good" school can only teach that much to an individual who does not have a good mindset and attitude towards learning.
A #GrowthMindset takes one further than a fixed mindset ever could.

Case in point, I was feeling unconfident.
So I did the research and analysis to gain clarity and uncover the belief and confidence that I am in fact, better than good!
As Sonia Sotomayor said, "A surplus of effort could overcome a deficit of confidence." It certainly did for me.
Make the effort. Take action.

**WE ARE THE POWER OF HOW POWERFUL WE BECOME.
WHAT EXPONENTIAL DID YOU CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF TODAY?**
