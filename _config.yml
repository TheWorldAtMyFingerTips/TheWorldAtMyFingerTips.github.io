  Hi there! I'm Megan, a Data Analytics enthusiast. Prior to this, I had lived and breathed Retail Merchandising. While the bulk of my career was categorized as "merchandising", I find myself immensely drawn and fulfilled by the analytics part of merchandising. I'm fueled by using data to simplify complexities into actionable insights. One thing led to another... and now, I am currently pursuing an Associate Data Analyst course with NTUC Learning Hub, enjoying Data Science modules of Python, PowerBI, SQL, and Excel!
