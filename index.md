### [EXCEL Interactive Dashboard - Sample Superstore (Retail)](/Excel_Dashboard.md)
This project is based off the context that my boss (my target audience) wants a dashboard with key performance indicators to enable an overview of the business, with the segregation by region (as each Head of Sales is charge of a region).

The dashboard will allow him to dynamically extract the relevant KPIs while speaking to each Head of Sales to get deeper insights as to why the metrics is so, with the ultimate objective of driving sales growth.

### [POWERBI - Global Superstore (Retail)](/PowerBI.md)
This project is based off the context that my boss wants an "app-like experience" in PowerBI, with dashboards which not only enable the overview of business, but also inspires actionable insights, with the ultimate objective of driving sales growth. It provides actionable angles of the overview, where, when, what, who, why, and hows.

The dashboard will be used by my boss and the various Sales Heads (whose responsibilities are segregated by region).
